          Question 01 : What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM? <br />
          Ans: <br />
          DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface
          that helps us to do many things to the elements from the document. The
          main purpose of the DOM is to select the nodes of the html element to
          change them as the requirements using getElementById() querySelector()
          querySelectorAll() etc.

          Question 02 : How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the
          DOM methods. <br />
          Ans: <br />
          To select HTML element using DOM, we can use various method. Like for
          example, to select the id we could use getElementById(), to select the
          class we could use getElementsByClassName() etc. Here is an exaple of
          hoe to select this method:<br />
          const myElement = document.getElementById("myId"); <br />
          There is also many more methods. Example_ querySelector(),
          getElementsByTagName() etc.

          Question 03 : What is event bubble? <br />
          Ans: <br />
          Suppose we have a button element inside a div element, and we click on
          the button, the click event will first be triggered on the button
          element, and then it will bubble up and trigger the same event on the
          div element that contains the button. If there are more parent
          elements, the event will continue to bubble up until it reaches the
          root element of the document. This event is called the bubble event.

          Question 04 : What is a callback function and why will you use it?
          <br />
          Ans: <br />
          A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to
          another function. A common use case for callback functions is
          asynchronous programming. When a function needs to perform an
          asynchronous operation, such as fetching data from a server, it cannot
          return the result immediately. Instead, it can accept a callback
          function as an argument. That's the reason why we used callback
          function.
